001:01;A3v[A  ]| Philosophy is odious and obscure:  
001:01;A3v[A  ]| Both Law and Physicke are for$4$ petty wits, 
001:01;A3v[A  ]| It is magick, magick, that$6#1$ hath rauisht me.  
001:01;A3v[A  ]| Then gentle friends aid me in$4$ this attempt, 
001:01;A3v[A  ]| And I, that$6#1$ have with subtle Sillogismes 
001:01;A3v[A  ]| Grauel'd the Pastors of the Germane Church,

001:01;A4r[A  ]| Will$1$ be as cunning as Agrippa was,

001:01;A4r[E  ]| Faustus, these bookes, thy wit, and our$6#2$ experience, 
001:01;A4r[E  ]| shall make all Nations to$9$ Canonize us$6#2$, 
001:01;A4r[E  ]| As Indian Moores, obey their Spanish Lords:

001:01;A4r[E  ]| Like$4$ Lyons shall they guard us$6#2$ when we$6#2$ please,

001:01;A4r[E  ]| Shadowing more beauty in$4$ their Airie browes, 
001:01;A4r[E  ]| Than has the white breasts of the Queene of love.  
001:01;A4r[E  ]| From Venice shall they drag huge Argosies,

001:01;A4r[E  ]| That$6#1$ yearely stuff'd old Phillips treasury, 
001:01;A4r[E  ]| If learned Faustus will$1$ be resolute.  
001:01;A4r[A  ]| Valdes, as resolute am I in$4$ this, 
001:01;A4r[A  ]| As thou to$9$ live, therefore obiect it not.  
001:01;A4r[H  ]| The miracles that$6#1$ magick will$1$ performe, 
001:01;A4r[H  ]| Will$1$ make thee vow to$9$ study nothing else.  
001:01;A4r[H  ]| He that$6#1$ is grounded in$4$ Astrology, 
001:01;A4r[H  ]| Inricht with tongues, well seene in$4$ Minerals, 
001:01;A4r[H  ]| Hath all the Principles Magick doth require:  
001:01;A4r[H  ]| Then doubt not Faustus but to$9$ be renowm'd, 
001:01;A4r[H  ]| And more frequented for$4$ this mysterie, 
001:01;A4r[H  ]| Than heeretofore the Delphian Oracle.  
001:01;A4r[H  ]| The spirits tell me they can dry the sea, 
001:01;A4r[H  ]| And fetch the treasure of all forraine wrackes:  
001:01;A4r[H  ]| Yea all the wealth that$6#1$ our$6#2$ fore-fathers hid, 
001:01;A4r[H  ]| Within the massy entrailes of the earth:  
001:01;A4r[H  ]| Then tell me Faustus what shall we$6#2$ three want?  
001:01;A4r[A  ]| Nothing Cornelius; O this cheeres my soule:  
001:01;A4r[A  ]| Come, shew me some demonstrations Magicall, 
001:01;A4r[A  ]| That$3$ I may coniure in$4$ some bushy Groue, 
001:01;A4r[A  ]| And have these ioies in$4$ full possession.  
001:01;A4r[E  ]| Then haste thee to$4$ some solitary Groue, 
001:01;A4v[E  ]| And beare wise Bacons, and Albanus workes,

001:01;A4v[H  ]| Valdes, first let him know the words of Art&H0;, 
001:01;A4v[H  ]| And then all other ceremonies learn'd, 
001:01;A4v[H  ]| Faustus may try his cunning by$4$ himself.  
001:01;A4v[E  ]| First I will$1$ instruct thee in$4$ the rudiments, 
001:01;A4v[E  ]| And then wilt thou be perfecter than I.  
001:01;A4v[A  ]| Then come and dine with me, and after meate 
001:01;A4v[A  ]| We$6#2$ will$1$ canuase <reg orig="euery">every</reg> quidditie thereof:  
001:01;A4v[A  ]| For$3$ <reg orig="e're">ere</reg> I sleep, I will$1$ try what I can do:

001:03;B1v[F  ]| Therefore the shortest cut for$4$ coniuring 
001:03;B1v[F  ]| It stoutly to$9$ abiure all godlinesse,

001:03;B1v[A  ]| So$5#2$ Faustus hath already done, and holds this principle, 
001:03;B1v[A  ]| There is no$2$ chiefe but onely Beelzebub:

001:03;B2r[F  ]| Yes Faustus, and most deerely lou'd of God.  
001:03;B2r[A  ]| How comes it then that$3$ he is Prince of Deuils?  
001:03;B2r[F  ]| O:  by$4$ aspiring pride and insolence, 
001:03;B2r[F  ]| For$4$ which$6#1$ God threw him from the face of heauen.  
001:03;B2r[A  ]| And what are you that$6#1$ live with Lucifer?  
001:03;B2r[F  ]| Vnhappy spirits that$6#1$ live with Lucifer,

001:03;B2r[A  ]| Where are you damn'd?  
001:03;B2r[F  ]| In$4$ hell.  
001:03;B2r[A  ]| How comes it then that$3$ thou are out of hell?  
001:03;B2r[F  ]| Why this is hell:  nor am I out of it.  
001:03;B2r[F  ]| Think'st thou that$3$ I that$6#1$ saw the face of God, 
001:03;B2r[F  ]| And tasted the eternall Ioyes of heauen, 
001:03;B2r[F  ]| Am not tormented with ten thousand hels, 
001:03;B2r[F  ]| In$4$ being depriu'd of euerlasting blisse?  
001:03;B2r[F  ]| O Faustus leaue these friuolous demandes, 
001:03;B2r[F  ]| Which$6#1$ strikes a terror to$4$ my fainting soule.  
001:03;B2r[A  ]| What is great Mephostophilis so$5#1$ passionate 
001:03;B2r[A  ]| For$4$ being depriued of the Ioyes of heauen?  
001:03;B2r[A  ]| Learne thou of Faustus manly fortitude, 
001:03;B2r[A  ]| And scorne those Ioyes thou <reg orig="neuer">never</reg> shalt possesse.  
001:03;B2r[A  ]| Go beare these tydings to$4$ great Lucifer, 
001:03;B2r[A  ]| Seeing Faustus hath incur'd eternall death, 
001:03;B2r[A  ]| By$4$ desperate thoughts against Ioues Deity:  
001:03;B2r[A  ]| Say he surrenders up$5$ to$4$ him his soule, 
001:03;B2r[A  ]| So$3$ he will$1$ spare him foure*and*twenty yeares, 
001:03;B2r[A  ]| Letting him live in$4$ all voluptuousnesse, 
001:03;B2r[A  ]| Having thee <reg orig="euer">ever</reg> to$9$ attend on$4$ me,

001:03;B2v[A  ]| And <reg orig="alwaies">always</reg> be obedient to$4$ my will$0$.  
001:03;B2v[A  ]| Go, and returne to$4$ mighty Lucifer, 
001:03;B2v[A  ]| And meet me in$4$ my Study, at Midnight, 
001:03;B2v[A  ]| And then resolue me of thy Maisters mind.  
001:03;B2v[F  ]| I will$1$ Faustus.

001:03;B2v[A  ]| Had I as many soules, as there be Starres, 
001:03;B2v[A  ]| I would give them all for$4$ Mephostophilis.  
001:03;B2v[A  ]| By$4$ him, I will$1$ be great emperour of the world, 
001:03;B2v[A  ]| And make a bridge, through the mouing Aire, 
001:03;B2v[A  ]| To$9$ passe the Ocean:  with a band of men 
001:03;B2v[A  ]| I will$1$ ioyne the Hils that$6#1$ bind the Affrick shore, 
001:03;B2v[A  ]| And make that$6#2$ Country, continent to$4$ Spaine, 
001:03;B2v[A  ]| And both contributary to$4$ my Crowne.  
001:03;B2v[A  ]| The Emperour shall not live, but by$4$ my leaue, 
001:03;B2v[A  ]| Nor any Potentate of Germany.  
001:03;B2v[A  ]| Now that$3$ I have obtain'd what I desir'd 
001:03;B2v[A  ]| I will$1$ live in$4$ speculation of this Art&H0; 
001:03;B2v[A  ]| Till Mephostophilis returne again.  
001:03;B2v['  ]| Exit.

002:01;B3v[C  ]| O they are meanes to$9$ bring thee unto heauen.  
002:01;B3v[D  ]| Rather illusions, fruits of lunacy.  
002:01;B3v[D  ]| That$6#1$ make them foolish that$6#1$ do vse them most.  
002:01;B3v[C  ]| Sweet Faustus think of heauen, and heauenly things.  
002:01;B3v[D  ]| No$7$ Faustus think of honour and of wealth.  
002:01;B3v['  ]| Ex.  An.

002:01;B3v[A  ]| Already Faustus hath hazarded that$6#2$ for$4$ thee.  
002:01;B3v[F  ]| But now thou must bequeath it solemnly,

002:01;B3v[F  ]| For$4$ that$6#2$ security craues Lucifer.  
002:01;B3v[F  ]| If thou deny it I must back to$4$ hell.

002:01;B3v[F  ]| Enlarge his Kingdome.  
002:01;B4r[A  ]| Is that$6#2$ the reason why he tempts us$6#2$ thus?

002:01;B4r[A  ]| Why, have you any paine that$6#1$ torture other?  
002:01;B4r[F  ]| As great as have the humane soules of men.  
002:01;B4r[F  ]| But tell me Faustus, shall I have thy soule?  
002:01;B4r[F  ]| And I will$1$ be thy slaue and waite on$4$ thee, 
002:01;B4r[F  ]| And give thee more than thou hast wit to$9$ aske.  
002:01;B4r[A  ]| Aye Mephostophilis, I will$1$ give it him.  
002:01;B4r[F  ]| Then Faustus stab thy Arme couragiously, 
002:01;B4r[F  ]| And bind thy soule, that$3$ at some certaine day 
002:01;B4r[F  ]| Great Lucifer may claime it as his <reg orig="owne">own</reg>, 
002:01;B4r[F  ]| And then be thou as great as Lucifer.  
002:01;B4r[A  ]| Loe Mephosto: for$4$ love of thee Faustus hath cut his arme, 
002:01;B4r[A  ]| And with his proper bloud assures his soule to$9$ be great Lucifers,

002:01;B4r[F  ]| But Faustus 
002:01;B4r[F  ]| Write it in$4$ manner of a Deed of Gift.  
002:01;B4r[A  ]| Aye so$5#2$ I do; but Mephostophilis 
002:01;B4r[A  ]| My bloud congeales, and I can write no$2$ more.  
002:01;B4r[F  ]| I will$1$ fetch thee fire to$9$ dissolue it streight.

002:01;B4r[A  ]| What might the staying of my bloud portend?

002:01;B4r[A  ]| Why streames it not, that$3$ I may write a*fresh?  
002:01;B4r[A  ]| Faustus giues to$4$ thee his soule:  O there it staid.

002:01;B4r[A  ]| <foreign>7Consummatum 7est</foreign>:  this byll is ended,

002:01;B4v[A  ]| But may I raise such spirits when I please?  
002:01;B4v[F  ]| Aye Faustus, and do greater things than these.  
002:01;B4v[A  ]| Then Mephostophilis receiue this scrole, 
002:01;B4v[A  ]| A Deed of Gift, of body and of soule:

002:01;B4v[A  ]| I Iohn Faustus of Wittenberg, Doctor, by$4$ these presents, do

002:01;C1r[A  ]| By$4$ me Iohn Faustus. 
002:01;C1r[F  ]| Speak Faustus, do you deliuer this as your Deed?  
002:01;C1r[A  ]| Aye take it, and the deuill give thee good of it.  
002:01;C1r[F  ]| So$3$, now Faustus aske me what thou wilt.  
002:01;C1r[A  ]| First, I will$1$ question thee about hell:  
002:01;C1r[A  ]| Tell me, where is the place that$6#1$ men call Hell?  
002:01;C1r[F  ]| Under the heauens.  
002:01;C1r[A  ]| Aye, so$5#2$ are all things else; but whereabouts?  
002:01;C1r[F  ]| Within the bowels of these Elements, 
002:01;C1r[F  ]| Where we$6#2$ are tortur'd, and remaine <reg orig="for euer">forever</reg>.  
002:01;C1r[F  ]| Hell hath no$2$ limits, nor is circumscrib'd, 
002:01;C1r[F  ]| In$4$ one self place:  but where we$6#2$ are is hell, 
002:01;C1r[F  ]| And where hell is there must we$6#2$ <reg orig="euer">ever</reg> be.  
002:01;C1r[F  ]| And to$9$ be short, when all the world dissolues, 
002:01;C1r[F  ]| And <reg orig="euery">every</reg> creature shall be purifi'd, 
002:01;C1r[F  ]| All places shall be hell that$6#1$ is not heauen.  
002:01;C1r[A  ]| I think Hel is a fable.  
002:01;C1r[F  ]| Aye, think so$5#2$ still, till experience change thy mind.  
002:01;C1r[A  ]| Why, dost thou think that$3$ Faustus shall be damn'd?  
002:01;C1r[F  ]| Aye, of necessity, for$3$ here is the scrowle 
002:01;C1r[F  ]| In$4$ which$6#1$ thou hast giuen thy soule to$4$ Lucifer.  
002:01;C1r[A  ]| Aye, and body too, but what of that$6#2$:  
002:01;C1r[A  ]| Think'st thou that$3$ Faustus, is so$5#1$ fond to$9$ imagine, 
002:01;C1r[A  ]| That$3$ after this life there is any paine?  
002:01;C1r[A  ]| No$7$, these are trifles, and meere old wiues Tales.  
002:01;C1r[F  ]| But I am an instance to$9$ proue the contrary:  
002:01;C1r[F  ]| For$3$ I tell thee I am damn'd, and now in$4$ hell.  
002:01;C1r[A  ]| Nay, if this be hell, I will$1$ willingly be damn'd.  
002:01;C1r[A  ]| What sleeping, eating, walking and disputing?  
002:01;C1r[A  ]| But leauing this, let me have a wife, the fairest Maid in$4$ 
002:01;C1r[A  ]| Germany, for$3$ I am wanton and lasciuious, and cannot live 
002:01;C1r[A  ]| without a wife.  
002:01;C1r[F  ]| Well Faustus, thou shalt have a wife.  
002:01;C1r['  ]| He fetches in$4$ a woman deuill. 
002:01;C1r[A  ]| What sight is this?  
002:01;C1v[F  ]| Now Faustus wilt thou have a wife?  
002:01;C1v[A  ]| Here is a hot whore indeed; no$7$, I will$1$ no$2$ wife.  
002:01;C1v[F  ]| Marriage is but a ceremoniall toy, 
002:01;C1v[F  ]| And if thou louest me think no$2$ more of it, 
002:01;C1v[F  ]| I will$1$ cull thee out the fairest Curtezans, 
002:01;C1v[F  ]| And bring them <reg orig="euery">every</reg> morning to$4$ thy bed:  
002:01;C1v[F  ]| She whom thine eye shall like$1$, thy heart shall have, 
002:01;C1v[F  ]| Were she as chaste as was Penelope; 
002:01;C1v[F  ]| As wise as Saba, or as beautifull 
002:01;C1v[F  ]| As was bright Lucifer before his fall.  
002:01;C1v[F  ]| Here, take this booke, and peruse it well:  
002:01;C1v[F  ]| The Iterating of these lines brings gold; 
002:01;C1v[F  ]| The framing of this circle on$4$ the ground 
002:01;C1v[F  ]| Brings Thunder, Whirle-winds, Storme and Lightning:  
002:01;C1v[F  ]| Pronounce this thrice deuoutly to$4$ thyself, 
002:01;C1v[F  ]| And men in$4$ harnesse shall appeare to$4$ thee, 
002:01;C1v[F  ]| Ready to$9$ execute what thou commandst.  
002:01;C1v[A  ]| Thankes Mephostophilis for$4$ this sweete booke.  
002:01;C1v[A  ]| This will$1$ I keepe, as chary as my life.  
002:01;C1v['  ]| Exeunt. 
002:01;C1v['  ]| Enter Wagner solus. 
002:01;C1v[B  ]| Learned Faustus

002:01;C1v[B  ]| Grauen in$4$ the booke of Ioues high firmament,

002:01;C1v[B  ]| Being seated in$4$ a chariot burning bright, 
002:01;C1v[B  ]| Drawne by$4$ the strength of yoaky Dragons necks, 
002:01;C1v[B  ]| He now is gone to$9$ proue Cosmography, 
002:01;C1v[B  ]| And as I gesse will$1$ first arriue at Rome, 
002:01;C1v[B  ]| To$9$ see the Pope and manner of his Court; 
002:01;C1v[B  ]| And take some part of holy Peters feast, 
002:01;C1v[B  ]| That$6#1$ to$4$ this day is highly solemnized.  
002:01;C1v['  ]| Exit Wagner. 
002:02;C1v['  ]| Enter Faustus in$4$ his Study, and Mephostophilis. 
002:02;C1v[A  ]| When I behold the heauens then I repent 
002:02;C1v[A  ]| And curse thee wicked Mephostophilis, 
002:02;C2r[A  ]| Because thou hast depriu'd me of those Ioyes.  
002:02;C2r[F  ]| It was thine <reg orig="owne">own</reg> seeking Faustus, thanke thyself.  
002:02;C2r[F  ]| But think'st thou heauen is such a glorious thing?  
002:02;C2r[F  ]| I tell thee Faustus it is not halfe so$5#1$ fair 
002:02;C2r[F  ]| As thou, or any man that$6#1$ breathe on$4$ earth.  
002:02;C2r[A  ]| How prou'st thou that$6#2$?  
002:02;C2r[F  ]| It was made for$4$ man; then he is more excellent.  
002:02;C2r[A  ]| If Heauen was made for$4$ man, it was made for$4$ me:  
002:02;C2r[A  ]| I will$1$ renounce this Magicke and repent.  
002:02;C2r['  ]| Enter the two Angels. 
002:02;C2r[C  ]| Faustus repent, yet God will$1$ pitty thee.  
002:02;C2r[D  ]| Thou art a spirit, God cannot pity thee.  
002:02;C2r[A  ]| Who$6#2$ buzzeth in$4$ mine eares I am a spirit?  
002:02;C2r[A  ]| Be I a deuill yet God may pitty me, 
002:02;C2r[A  ]| Yea, God will$1$ pitty me if I repent.  
002:02;C2r[D  ]| Aye, but Faustus <reg orig="neuer">never</reg> shall repent.  
002:02;C2r['  ]| Exit Angels. 
002:02;C2r[A  ]| My heart is hardned, I cannot repent:  
002:02;C2r[A  ]| Scarce can I name saluation, faith, or heauen.  
002:02;C2r[A  ]| Swords, poyson, halters, and inuenomb'd steele, 
002:02;C2r[A  ]| Are laid before me to$9$ dispatch myself:  
002:02;C2r[A  ]| And long <reg orig="e're">ere</reg> this, I should have done the deed, 
002:02;C2r[A  ]| Had not sweete pleasure conquer'd deepe despaire.  
002:02;C2r[A  ]| Have not I made blind Homer sing to$4$ me 
002:02;C2r[A  ]| Of Alexanders love, and Oenons death?  
002:02;C2r[A  ]| And hath not he that$6#1$ built the walles of Thebes, 
002:02;C2r[A  ]| With rauishing sound of his melodious Harpe, 
002:02;C2r[A  ]| Made musicke with my Mephostophilis?  
002:02;C2r[A  ]| Why should I die then, or basely despaire?  
002:02;C2r[A  ]| I am resolu'd, Faustus shall not repent.  
002:02;C2r[A  ]| Come Mephostophilis let us$6#2$ dispute again, 
002:02;C2r[A  ]| And reason of diuine Astrology.  
002:02;C2r[A  ]| Speak, are there many Spheares above the Moone?  
002:02;C2r[A  ]| Are all Celestiall bodies but one Globe, 
002:02;C2r[A  ]| As is the substance of this centricke earth?  
002:02;C2v[F  ]| As are the elements, such are the heauens,

002:02;C2v[F  ]| Mutually folded in$4$ each others Spheares, 
002:02;C2v[F  ]| And iontly moue upon$4$ one Axle-tree, 
002:02;C2v[F  ]| Whose termine, is tearmed the worlds wide Pole.  
002:02;C2v[F  ]| Nor are the names of Saturne, Mars, or Iupiter, 
002:02;C2v[F  ]| Fain'd, but are euening Starres.  
002:02;C2v[A  ]| But have they all one motion, both <foreign>7situ 7& 7tempore</foreign>?

002:02;C2v[F  ]| their motions upon$4$ the poles of the Zodiacke.  
002:02;C2v[A  ]| These slender questions Wagner can decide:  
002:02;C2v[A  ]| Hath Mephostophilis no$2$ greater skill?  
002:02;C2v[A  ]| Who$6#2$ knowes not the double motion of the Planets?  
002:02;C2v[A  ]| That$3$ the first is finisht in$4$ a naturall day?  
002:02;C2v[A  ]| The second thus, Saturne in$4$ 30 yeares; 
002:02;C2v[A  ]| Iupiter in$4$ 12, Mars in$4$ 4, the Sun, Venus, and 
002:02;C2v[A  ]| Mercury in$4$ a yeare; the Moone in$4$ twenty*eight daies.  
002:02;C2v[A  ]| These are fresh*mens questions:  But tell me, hath <reg orig="euery">every</reg>

002:02;C2v[F  ]| Aye.  
002:02;C2v[A  ]| How many Heauens, or Spheares, are there?  
002:02;C2v[F  ]| Nine, the seuen Planets, the Firmament, and the 
002:02;C2v[F  ]| Emperiall heauen.  
002:02;C2v[A  ]| But is there not <foreign>7Co*elum 7igneum, 7& 7Christallinum</foreign>?  
002:02;C2v[F  ]| No$7$ Faustus they be but Fables.  
002:02;C2v[A  ]| Resolue me then in$4$ this one question:  
002:02;C2v[A  ]| Why are not Coniunctions, Oppositions, Aspects, Eclipses,  
002:02;C2v[A  ]| all at one time, but in$4$ some years we$6#2$ have

002:02;C2v[A  ]| Well, I am answer'd:  now tell me who$6#2$ made the world?

002:02;C2v[F  ]| Aye, that$6#1$ is not against our$6#2$ kingdome.  
002:02;C2v[F  ]| This is:  Thou art damn'd, think thou of hell.  
002:02;C2v[A  ]| Think Faustus upon$4$ God, that$6#1$ made the world.  
002:02;C2v[F  ]| Remember this. ~~

002:02;C3v[A  ]| the second?  
002:02;C3v[WB ]| I am Couetousnesse:  begotten of an old Churle

002:02;C3v[WC ]| I live alone, then thou <reg orig="'shoul'st">shouldst</reg> see how fat I would be.  But must

002:02;C3v[A  ]| Out enuious wretch:  But what art thou the fourth?  
002:02;C3v[WD ]| I am Wrath:  I had neither father nor mother, I

002:02;C3v[AQ ]| And what art thou the fift?  
002:02;C3v[WE ]| I am Gluttony; my parents are all dead, and the deuill

002:02;C4r[A  ]| Not I.  
002:02;C4r[WE ]| Then the deuill chooke thee.  
002:02;C4r[A  ]| Choke thyself Glutton:  What art thou the sixt?

002:02;C4r[A  ]| And what are you Mistris Minkes, the seuenth and last?

002:02;C4r[A  ]| O how this sight doth delight my soule.  
002:02;C4r[K  ]| But Faustus, in$4$ hell is all manner of delight.  
002:02;C4r[A  ]| O might I see hell, and returne again safe, how 
002:02;C4r[A  ]| happy were I then.  
002:02;C4r[K  ]| Faustus, thou shalt, at midnight I will$1$ send for$4$ thee;

002:03;C4v[U  ]| Drawne by$4$ the strength of yoked Dragons neckes;

002:03;C4v[U  ]| And in$4$ eight daies did bring him home again.  
002:03;D1r[U  ]| Not long he stayed within$4$ his quiet house,

002:03;D1r['  ]| Exit. 
003:01;D1r['  ]| Enter Faustus and Mephostophilis. 
003:01;D1r[A  ]| Having now my good Mephostophilis, 
003:01;D1r[A  ]| Past with delight the stately Towne of Trier:  
003:01;D1r[A  ]| Inuironed round with airy mountaine tops, 
003:01;D1r[A  ]| With wals of Flint, and deepe intrenched Lakes, 
003:01;D1r[A  ]| Not to$9$ be wonne by$4$ any conquering Prince.  
003:01;D1r[A  ]| From Paris next, costing the Realme of France, 
003:01;D1r[A  ]| We$6#2$ saw the Riuer Maine, fall into Rhines, 
003:01;D1r[A  ]| Whose bankes are set with Groues of fruitfull Vines.  
003:01;D1r[A  ]| Than up$5$ to$4$ Naples, rich Campania, 
003:01;D1r[A  ]| Whose buildings fair, and gorgeous to$4$ the eye, 
003:01;D1r[A  ]| The streetes straight forth, and paued with finest bricke.  
003:01;D1r[A  ]| There saw we$6#2$ learned Maroes golden tombe:  
003:01;D1r[A  ]| The way he cut an English mile in$4$ length, 
003:01;D1r[A  ]| Through a rocke of stone in$4$ one nights space:  
003:01;D1r[A  ]| From thence to$4$ Venice, Padua, and the East, 
003:01;D1r[A  ]| In$4$ one of which$6#1$ a sumptuous Temple stands, 
003:01;D1r[A  ]| That$6#1$ threates the starres with her$2$ aspiring top, 
003:01;D1r[A  ]| Whose frame is paued with sundry coloured stones, 
003:01;D1r[A  ]| And roof't aloft with curious worke in$4$ gold.  
003:01;D1r[A  ]| Thus hitherto hath Faustus spent his time.  
003:01;D1r[A  ]| But tell me now, what resting place is this?  
003:01;D1r[A  ]| Hast thou, as earst I did command, 
003:01;D1r[A  ]| Conducted me within$4$ the walles of Rome?  
003:01;D1r[F  ]| I have my Faustus, and for$4$ proofe thereof, 
003:01;D1v[F  ]| This is the goodly Palace of the Pope:  
003:01;D1v[F  ]| And cause we$6#2$ are no$2$ common guests, 
003:01;D1v[F  ]| I chuse his priuy chamber for$4$ our$6#2$ vse.  
003:01;D1v[A  ]| I hope his Holinesse will$1$ bid us$6#2$ welcome.  
003:01;D1v[F  ]| All is one, for$3$ we$6#2$ will$1$ be bold with his Venson.  
003:01;D1v[F  ]| But now my Faustus, that$3$ thou mayst perceiue, 
003:01;D1v[F  ]| What Rome containes for$3$ to$9$ delight thine eyes.  
003:01;D1v[F  ]| Know that$3$ this City stands upon$4$ seuen hils, 
003:01;D1v[F  ]| That$6#1$ vnderprop the ground-worke of the same:  
003:01;D1v[F  ]| Iust through the midst runnes flowing Tybers streame, 
003:01;D1v[F  ]| With winding bankes that$6#1$ cut it in$4$ two parts; 
003:01;D1v[F  ]| Over the which$6#1$ two stately Bridges leane, 
003:01;D1v[F  ]| That$6#1$ make safe passage, to$4$ each part of Rome.  
003:01;D1v[F  ]| Upon$4$ the Bridge, call'd Ponto Angelo, 
003:01;D1v[F  ]| Erected is a Castle passing strong, 
003:01;D1v[F  ]| Where thou shalt see such store of Ordinance, 
003:01;D1v[F  ]| As that$3$ the double Cannons forg'd of brasse, 
003:01;D1v[F  ]| Do watch the number of the daies contain'd, 
003:01;D1v[F  ]| Within the compasse of one compleat yeare:  
003:01;D1v[F  ]| Beside the gates, and high Pyramydes, 
003:01;D1v[F  ]| That$6#1$ Iulius Ca*esar brought from Affrica.  
003:01;D1v[A  ]| Now by$4$ the Kingdomes of Infernall Rule, 
003:01;D1v[A  ]| Of Stix, of Archeron, and the fiery Lake, 
003:01;D1v[A  ]| Of euer-burning Phlegeton, I sweare, 
003:01;D1v[A  ]| That$3$ I do long to$9$ see the Monuments 
003:01;D1v[A  ]| And situation of bright splendent Rome, 
003:01;D1v[A  ]| Come therefore, let us$6#2$ away.  
003:01;D1v[F  ]| Nay stay my Faustus:  I know you would see the Pope 
003:01;D1v[F  ]| And take some part of holy Peters feast, 
003:01;D1v[F  ]| The which$6#1$ this day with high solemnity, 
003:01;D1v[F  ]| This day is held through Rome and Italy, 
003:01;D1v[F  ]| In$4$ honour of the Popes triumphant victory.  
003:01;D1v[A  ]| Sweet Mephosto. thou pleasest me 
003:01;D1v[A  ]| Whilst I am here on$4$ earth:  Let me be cloyd 
003:01;D1v[A  ]| With all things that$6#1$ delight the heart of man.  
003:01;D1v[A  ]| My foure*and*twenty yeares of liberty 
003:01;D1v[A  ]| I will$1$ spend in$4$ pleasure and in$4$ daliance, 
003:01;D1v[A  ]| That$3$ Faustus name, whilst this bright frame doth stand, 
003:01;D2r[A  ]| May be admired through the furthest land.  
003:01;D2r[F  ]| It is well said Faustus, come then stand by$4$ me 
003:01;D2r[F  ]| And thou shalt see them come immediately.  
003:01;D2r[A  ]| Nay stay my gentle Mephotosophilis, 
003:01;D2r[A  ]| And grant me my request, and then I go.  
003:01;D2r[A  ]| Thou know'st within$4$ the compasse of eight daies, 
003:01;D2r[A  ]| We$6#2$ veiw'd the face of heauen, of earth and hell.  
003:01;D2r[A  ]| So$5#1$ high our$6#2$ Dragons soar'd into the aire, 
003:01;D2r[A  ]| That$3$ looking down the earth appear'd to$4$ me, 
003:01;D2r[A  ]| No$2$ bigger than my hand in$4$ quantity.  
003:01;D2r[A  ]| There did we$6#2$ view the Kingdomes of the world, 
003:01;D2r[A  ]| And what might please mine eye, I there beheld.  
003:01;D2r[A  ]| Then in$4$ this shew let me an Actor be, 
003:01;D2r[A  ]| That$3$ this proud Pope may Faustus comming see.  
003:01;D2r[F  ]| Let it be so$5#2$ my Faustus, but first stay, 
003:01;D2r[F  ]| And view their triumphs, as they passe this way.  
003:01;D2r[F  ]| And then deuise what best contents thy minde, 
003:01;D2r[F  ]| By$4$ comming in$4$ thine Arts to$9$ crosse the Pope, 
003:01;D2r[F  ]| Or dash the pride of this solemnity; 
003:01;D2r[F  ]| To$9$ make his Monkes and Abbots stand like$4$ Apes, 
003:01;D2r[F  ]| And point like$4$ Antiques at his triple Crowne:  
003:01;D2r[F  ]| To$9$ beate the Beades about the Friers Pates, 
003:01;D2r[F  ]| Or clap huge hornes, upon$4$ the Cardinals heads:  
003:01;D2r[F  ]| Or any villany thou canst deuise, 
003:01;D2r[F  ]| And I will$1$ performe it Faustus:  heark they come:  
003:01;D2r[F  ]| This day shall make thee be admir'd in$4$ Rome.  
003:01;D2r['  ]| Enter the Cardinals and Bishops, some bearing Crosiers, some 
003:01;D2r['  ]| the Pillars, Monkes and Friers, singing their Procession: 
003:01;D2r['  ]| Then the Pope, and Raymond King of Hungary, 
003:01;D2r['  ]| with Bruno led in$4$ chaines. 
003:01;D2r[N  ]| Cast down our$6#1$ Foot-stoole.  
003:01;D2r[WH ]| Saxon Bruno stoope, 
003:01;D2r[WH ]| Whilst on$4$ thy back his hollinesse ascends 
003:01;D2r[WH ]| Saint Peters Chaire and State Pontificall.  
003:01;D2r[O  ]| Proud Lucifer, that$6#2$ State belongs to$4$ me:  
003:01;D2r[O  ]| But thus I fall to$4$ Peter, not to$4$ thee.  
003:01;D2v[N  ]| To$4$ me and Peter, shalt thou groueling lie, 
003:01;D2v[N  ]| And crouch before the Papall dignity:  
003:01;D2v[N  ]| Sound Trumpets then, for$3$ thus Saint Peters Heire, 
003:01;D2v[N  ]| From Bruno's back, ascends Saint Peters Chaire.  
003:01;D2v['  ]| A Flourish while he ascends. 
003:01;D2v[N  ]| Thus, as the Gods, creepe on$5$ with feete of wood, 
003:01;D2v[N  ]| Long ere with Iron hands they punish men, 
003:01;D2v[N  ]| So$5#2$ shall our$6#1$ sleeping vengeance now arise, 
003:01;D2v[N  ]| And smite with death thy hated enterprise.  
003:01;D2v[N  ]| Lord Cardinals of France and Padua, 
003:01;D2v[N  ]| Go forth-with to$4$ our$6#1$ holy Consistory, 
003:01;D2v[N  ]| And read amongst the Statutes Decretall, 
003:01;D2v[N  ]| What by$4$ the holy Councell held at Trent, 
003:01;D2v[N  ]| The sacred Sinod hath decreed for$4$ him, 
003:01;D2v[N  ]| That$6#1$ doth assume the Papall gouernment, 
003:01;D2v[N  ]| Without election, and a true consent:  
003:01;D2v[N  ]| Away and bring us$6#1$ word with speed.  
003:01;D2v[W  ]| We$6#2$ go my Lord.  
003:01;D2v['  ]| Exeunt Cardinals. 
003:01;D2v[N  ]| Lord Raymond.  
003:01;D2v[A  ]| Go haste thee gentle Mephostophilis, 
003:01;D2v[A  ]| Follow the Cardinals to$4$ the Consistory; 
003:01;D2v[A  ]| And as they turne their superstitious Bookes, 
003:01;D2v[A  ]| Strike them with sloth, and drowsy idlenesse; 
003:01;D2v[A  ]| And make them sleepe so$5#1$ sound, that$3$ in$4$ their shapes, 
003:01;D2v[A  ]| Thyself and I, may parly with this Pope:  
003:01;D2v[A  ]| This proud confronter of the Emperour, 
003:01;D2v[A  ]| And in$4$ despite of all his Holinesse 
003:01;D2v[A  ]| Restore this Bruno to$4$ his liberty, 
003:01;D2v[A  ]| And beare him to$4$ the States of Germany.  
003:01;D2v[F  ]| Faustus, I go.  
003:01;D2v[A  ]| Dispath it soon, 
003:01;D2v[A  ]| The Pope shall curse that$3$ Faustus came to$4$ Rome.  
003:01;D2v['  ]| Exit Faustus and Meph. 
003:01;D2v[O  ]| Pope Adrian let me have some right of Law, 
003:01;D2v[O  ]| I was elected by$4$ the Emperour.  
003:01;D2v[N  ]| We$6#1$ will$1$ depose the Emperour for$4$ that$6#2$ deed, 
003:01;D2v[N  ]| And curse the people that$6#1$ submit to$4$ him; 
003:01;D2v[N  ]| Both he and thou shalt stand excommunicate, 
003:01;D3r[N  ]| And interdict from Churches priuiledge, 
003:01;D3r[N  ]| And all society of holy men:  
003:01;D3r[N  ]| He growes too prowd in$4$ his authority, 
003:01;D3r[N  ]| Lifting his loftie head above the clouds, 
003:01;D3r[N  ]| And like$4$ a Steeple ouer-peeres the Church.  
003:01;D3r[N  ]| But we$6#1$ will$1$ pul down his haughty insolence:  
003:01;D3r[N  ]| And as Pope Alexander our$6#1$ Progenitour, 
003:01;D3r[N  ]| Trode on$4$ the neck of Germane Fredericke, 
003:01;D3r[N  ]| Adding this golden sentence to$4$ our$6#1$ praise; 
003:01;D3r[N  ]| That$3$ Peters heires should tread on$4$ Emperours, 
003:01;D3r[N  ]| And walke upon$4$ the dreadfull Adders back, 
003:01;D3r[N  ]| Treading the Lyon, and the Dragon down.  
003:01;D3r[N  ]| And fearelesse spurne the killing Basiliske:  
003:01;D3r[N  ]| So$5#2$ will$1$ we$6#1$ quell that$6#2$ haughty Schismatique; 
003:01;D3r[N  ]| And by$4$ authority Apostolicall 
003:01;D3r[N  ]| Depose him from his Regal Gouernment.  
003:01;D3r[O  ]| Pope Iulius swore to$4$ Princely Sigismond, 
003:01;D3r[O  ]| For$4$ him, and the succeeding Popes of Rome, 
003:01;D3r[O  ]| To$9$ hold the Emperours their lawfull Lords.  
003:01;D3r[N  ]| Pope Iulius did abuse the Churches Rites, 
003:01;D3r[N  ]| And therefore none of his Decrees can stand.  
003:01;D3r[N  ]| Is not all power on$4$ earth bestowed on$4$ us$6#1$?  
003:01;D3r[N  ]| And therefore though we$6#1$ would we$6#1$ cannot erre.  
003:01;D3r[N  ]| Behold this Siluer Belt whereto is fixt 
003:01;D3r[N  ]| Seuen golden seales fast sealed with seuen seales, 
003:01;D3r[N  ]| In$4$ token of our$6#1$ seuen-fold power from heauen, 
003:01;D3r[N  ]| To$9$ binde or loose, lock fast, condemne, or iudge, 
003:01;D3r[N  ]| Resigne, or seale, or what so$5#2$ pleaseth us$6#1$.  
003:01;D3r[N  ]| Then he and thou, and all the world shall stoope, 
003:01;D3r[N  ]| Or be assured of our$6#1$ dreadfull curse, 
003:01;D3r[N  ]| To$9$ light as heauy as the paines of hell.  
003:01;D3r['  ]| Enter Faustus and Mephosto% like$4$ the Cardinals. 
003:01;D3r[F  ]| Now tell me Faustus, are we$6#2$ not fitted well?  
003:01;D3r[A  ]| Yes Mephosto% and two such Cardinals 
003:01;D3r[A  ]| <reg orig="Ne're">Never</reg> seru'd a holy Pope, as we$6#2$ shall do.  
003:01;D3r[A  ]| But whilst they sleepe within$4$ the Consistory, 
003:01;D3v[A  ]| Let us$6#2$ salute his reuerend Father-hood.  
003:01;D3v[WH ]| Behold my Lord, the Cardinals are return'd.

003:01;D3v[A  ]| That$3$ Bruno, and the Germane Emperour 
003:01;D3v[A  ]| Be held as Lollords, and bold Schismatiques, 
003:01;D3v[A  ]| And proud disturbers of the Churches peace.  
003:01;D3v[A  ]| And if that$3$ Bruno by$4$ his own assent, 
003:01;D3v[A  ]| Without inforcement of the German Peeres, 
003:01;D3v[A  ]| Did seeke to$9$ weare the triple Dyadem, 
003:01;D3v[A  ]| And by$4$ your death to$9$ clime S% Peters Chaire, 
003:01;D3v[A  ]| The Statutes Decretall have thus decreed, 
003:01;D3v[A  ]| He shall be streight condemn'd of heresie, 
003:01;D3v[A  ]| And on$4$ a pile of Fagots burnt to$4$ death.  
003:01;D3v[N  ]| It is enough:  here, take him to$4$ your charge, 
003:01;D3v[N  ]| And beare him streight to$4$ Ponto Angelo, 
003:01;D3v[N  ]| And in$4$ the strongest Tower inclose him fast, 
003:01;D3v[N  ]| Tomorrow, sitting in$4$ our$6#1$ Consistory, 
003:01;D3v[N  ]| With all our$6#1$ Colledge of graue Cardinals, 
003:01;D3v[N  ]| We$6#1$ will$1$ determine of his life or death.  
003:01;D3v[N  ]| Here, take his triple Crowne along with you, 
003:01;D3v[N  ]| And leaue it in$4$ the Churches treasury.  
003:01;D3v[N  ]| Make haste again, my good Lord Cardinalls, 
003:01;D3v[N  ]| And take our$6#1$ blessing Apostolicall.  
003:01;D3v[F  ]| So$3$, so$3$, was <reg orig="neuer">never</reg> Diuell thus blest before.  
003:01;D3v[A  ]| Away sweet Mephosto, be gone,

003:01;D3v[N  ]| That$3$ we$6#1$ may solemnize S% Peters feast, 
003:01;D3v[N  ]| And with Lord Raymond, King of Hungary,

003:02;D4r[F  ]| Now Faustus, come prepare thyself for$4$ mirth, 
003:02;D4r[F  ]| The sleepy Cardinals are hard at hand, 
003:02;D4r[F  ]| To$9$ censure Bruno, that$6#1$ is posted hence,

003:02;D4r[A  ]| That$6#1$ slept both Bruno and his crowne away, 
003:02;D4r[A  ]| But now, that$3$ Faustus may delight his minde,

003:02;D4r['  ]| Enter Pope and all the Lords.  Enter the Cardinals 
003:02;D4r['  ]| with a Booke.

003:02;D4v[N  ]| What needs this question?  Did I not tell you,

003:02;D4v[N  ]| For$4$ lothed Lollords, and base Schismatiques:

003:02;D4v[WI ]| Your Grace mistakes, you gaue us$6#2$ no$2$ such charge.  
003:02;D4v[WH ]| Deny it not, we$6#2$ all are witnesses

003:02;D4v[X  ]| By$4$ holy Paul we$6#2$ saw them not.  
003:02;D4v[N  ]| By$4$ Peter you shall dye, 
003:02;D4v[N  ]| Vnlesse you bring them forth immediately:  
003:02;D4v[N  ]| Hale them to$4$ prison, lade their limbes with gyues:

003:03;E2r[F  ]| carry him upon$4$ thy back; away be gone.  
003:03;E2r[G  ]| A dog?  that$6#2$ is excellent:  let the Maids look well to$4$ 
003:03;E2r[G  ]| their porridge-pots, for$3$ I will$1$ into the Kitchin presently:  come 
003:03;E2r[G  ]| Dick, come.

004:01;E2v[Q  ]| Will$1$ not his grace consort the Emperour.  
004:01;E2v[P  ]| O yes, and with him comes the Germane Coniurer.

004:01;E2v[P  ]| Of Alexander and his beauteous Paramour.  
004:01;E2v[Q  ]| Where is Benuolio?  
004:01;E2v[P  ]| Fast a*sleepe I warrant you, 
004:01;E2v[P  ]| He took his rouse with stopes of Rhennish wine, 
004:01;E2v[P  ]| So$5#1$ kindly yesternight to$4$ Bruno's health, 
004:01;E2v[P  ]| That$3$ all this day the sluggard keepes his bed.  
004:01;E2v[Q  ]| See, see his window is ope, we$6#2$ will$1$ call to$4$ him.  
004:01;E2v[P  ]| What hoe, Benuolio.

004:01;E2v[P  ]| As <reg orig="neuer">never</reg> yet was seene in$4$ Germany.  
004:01;E2v[R  ]| Has not the Pope enough of coniuring yet?  
004:01;E2v[R  ]| He was upon$4$ the deuils back late enough; 
004:01;E2v[R  ]| And if he be so$5#1$ farre in$4$ love with him, 
004:01;E3r[R  ]| I would he would post with him to$4$ Rome again.  
004:01;E3r[Q  ]| Speak, wilt thou come and see this sport?  
004:01;E3r[R  ]| Not I.

004:01;E3r[R  ]| for$4$ this once to$9$ thrust my head out at a window:  for$3$ they say, 
004:01;E3r[R  ]| if a man be drunke ouer*night, the Diuell cannot hurt him in$4$ 
004:01;E3r[R  ]| the morning:  if that$6#2$ be true, I have a charme in$4$ my head,  
004:01;E3r[R  ]| shall controule him as well as the Coniurer, I warrant you.  
004:01;E3r['  ]| Exit. 
004:02;E3r['  ]| A Senit.  Charles the Germane Emperour, Bruno,

004:02;E3r[WO ]| Wonder of men, renown'd Magitian, 
004:02;E3r[WO ]| Thrice*learned Faustus, welcome to$4$ our$6#1$ Court.  
004:02;E3r[WO ]| This deed of thine, in$4$ setting Bruno free 
004:02;E3r[WO ]| From his and our$6#1$ professed enemy, 
004:02;E3r[WO ]| Shall adde more excellence unto thine Art&H0;, 
004:02;E3r[WO ]| Than if by$4$ powerfull Necromantick spels, 
004:02;E3r[WO ]| Thou couldst command the worlds obedience:  
004:02;E3r[WO ]| <reg orig="For euer">Forever</reg> be belou'd of Carolus.  
004:02;E3r[WO ]| And if this Bruno thou hast late redeem'd,

004:02;E3r[WO ]| And sit in$4$ Peters Chaire, despite of chance,

004:02;E3r[A  ]| These gracious words, most royall Carolus,

004:02;E3r[A  ]| For$4$ proofe whereof, if so$5#2$ your Grace be pleas'd, 
004:02;E3v[A  ]| The Doctor stands prepar'd, by$4$ power of Art&H0;,

004:02;E3v[A  ]| To$9$ compasse <reg orig="whatsoere">whatsoever</reg> your grace commands.  
004:02;E3v[R  ]| Bloud he speakes terribly:  but for$4$ all that$6#2$, I do not 
004:02;E3v[R  ]| greatly beleeue him, he lookes as like$4$ Coniurer as the Pope to$4$ 
004:02;E3v[R  ]| a Coster-monger.  
004:02;E3v[WO ]| Then Faustus as thou late didst promise us$6#1$, 
004:02;E3v[WO ]| We$6#1$ would behold that$6#2$ famous Conquerour, 
004:02;E3v[WO ]| Great Alexander, and his Paramour, 
004:02;E3v[WO ]| In$4$ their true shapes, and state Maiesticall, 
004:02;E3v[WO ]| That$3$ we$6#1$ may wonder at their excellence.  
004:02;E3v[A  ]| Your Maiesty shall see them presently, 
004:02;E3v[A  ]| Mephosto away.  
004:02;E3v[A  ]| And with a solemne noyse of trumpets sound, 
004:02;E3v[A  ]| Present before this royall Emperour, 
004:02;E3v[A  ]| Great Alexander and his beauteous Paramour.  
004:02;E3v[F  ]| Faustus I will$1$.  
004:02;E3v[R  ]| Well M% Doctor, if your Diuels come not away 
004:02;E3v[R  ]| quickly, you shall have me asleepe presently:  zounds I could 
004:02;E3v[R  ]| eate myself for$4$ anger, to$9$ think I have been such an Asse 
004:02;E3v[R  ]| all this while, to$9$ stand gaping after the diuels Gouernor, and 
004:02;E3v[R  ]| can see nothing.  
004:02;E3v[A  ]| I will$1$ make you feele something anon, if my Art&H0; faile 
004:02;E3v[A  ]| me not.  
004:02;E3v[A  ]| My Lord, I must forewarne your Maiesty, 
004:02;E3v[A  ]| That$3$ when my Spirits present the royall shapes 
004:02;E3v[A  ]| Of Alexander and his Paramour, 
004:02;E3v[A  ]| Your grace demand no$2$ questions of the King, 
004:02;E3v[A  ]| But in$4$ dumbe silence let them come and go.  
004:02;E3v[WO ]| Be it as Faustus please, we$6#1$ are content.  
004:02;E3v[R  ]| Aye, aye, and I am content too:  and thou bring Alexander 
004:02;E3v[R  ]| and his Paramour before the Emperour, I will$1$ be Acteon, 
004:02;E3v[R  ]| and turne myself to$4$ a Stagge.  
004:02;E3v[A  ]| And I will$1$ play Diana, and send you the hornes presently.  
004:02;E3v[A  ]| 
004:02;E4r['  ]| Senit.  Enter at one the Emperour Alexander, at the other 
004:02;E4r['  ]| Darius; they meete, Darius is throwne down, Alexander 
004:02;E4r['  ]| kills him; takes off his Crowne, and offering to$9$ go 
004:02;E4r['  ]| out, his Paramour meetes him, he embraceth her$6$, and 
004:02;E4r['  ]| sets Darius Crowne upon$4$ her$2$ head; and commig 
004:02;E4r['  ]| back, both salute the Emperour, 
004:02;E4r['  ]| who$6#1$ leauing his State, offers to$9$ embrace 
004:02;E4r['  ]| them, which$6#1$ Faustus seeing, 
004:02;E4r['  ]| suddenly staies him.  Then trumpets 
004:02;E4r['  ]| cease, and Musicke 
004:02;E4r['  ]| sounds. 
004:02;E4r[A  ]| My gracious Lord, you do forget yourself, 
004:02;E4r[A  ]| These are but shadowes, not substantiall.  
004:02;E4r[WO ]| O pardon me, my thoughts are so$5#1$ rauished 
004:02;E4r[WO ]| With sight of this renowned Emperour, 
004:02;E4r[WO ]| That$3$ in$4$ mine armes I would have compast him.  
004:02;E4r[WO ]| But Faustus, since I may not speak to$4$ them, 
004:02;E4r[WO ]| To$9$ satisfie my longing thoughts at full, 
004:02;E4r[WO ]| Let me this tell thee:  I have heard it said, 
004:02;E4r[WO ]| That$3$ this fair Lady, whilest she liu'd on$4$ earth, 
004:02;E4r[WO ]| Had on$4$ her$2$ necke a little wart, or mole; 
004:02;E4r[WO ]| How may I proue that$6#2$ saying to$9$ be true?  
004:02;E4r[A  ]| Your Maiesty may boldly go and see.  
004:02;E4r[WO ]| Faustus I see it plaine, 
004:02;E4r[WO ]| And in$4$ this sight thou better pleasest me, 
004:02;E4r[WO ]| Than if I gain'd another Monarchie.  
004:02;E4r[A  ]| Away, be gone.  
004:02;E4r['  ]| Exit Show. 
004:02;E4r[A  ]| See, see, my gracious Lord, what strange beast is yon, that$6#1$ 
004:02;E4r[A  ]| thrusts his head out at window.  
004:02;E4r[WO ]| O wondrous sight:  see Duke of Saxony, 
004:02;E4r[WO ]| Two spreading hornes most strangely fastened 
004:02;E4r[WO ]| Upon$4$ the head of yong Benvolio.  
004:02;E4r[WO ]| What is he asleepe, or dead?  
004:02;E4r[A  ]| He sleeps my Lord, but dreames not of his hornes.  
004:02;E4r[WO ]| This sport is excellent:  we$6#1$ will$1$ call and wake him.  
004:02;E4r[WO ]| What ho, Benvolio.  
004:02;E4v[R  ]| A plague upon$4$ you, let me sleepe a while.  
004:02;E4v[WO ]| I blame thee not to$9$ sleepe  much, having such a head 
004:02;E4v[WO ]| of thine <reg orig="owne">own</reg>.  
004:02;E4v[WO ]| Look up$5$ Benvolio, it is the Emperour calls.  
004:02;E4v[R  ]| The Emperour?  where?  O zounds my head.  
004:02;E4v[WO ]| Nay, if thy hornes hold, it is no$2$ matter for$4$ thy 
004:02;E4v[WO ]| head, for$3$ that$6#2$ is arm'd sufficiently.  
004:02;E4v[A  ]| Why how now sir Knight, what hang'd by$4$ the 
004:02;E4v[A  ]| hornes?  this most horrible:  fie, fie, pull in$4$ your head for$4$ shame, 
004:02;E4v[A  ]| let not all the world wonder at you.  
004:02;E4v[R  ]| Zounds Doctor, is this your villany?  
004:02;E4v[A  ]| O say not so$5#2$ sir:  the Doctor has no$2$ skill, 
004:02;E4v[A  ]| No$2$ Art&H0;, no$2$ cunning, to$9$ present these Lords, 
004:02;E4v[A  ]| Or bring before this royall Emperour 
004:02;E4v[A  ]| The mightie Monarch, warlicke Alexander.  
004:02;E4v[A  ]| If Faustus do it, you are streight resolu'd, 
004:02;E4v[A  ]| In$4$ bold Acteons shape to$9$ turne a Stagge.  
004:02;E4v[A  ]| And therefore my Lord, so$3$ please your Maiesty, 
004:02;E4v[A  ]| I will$1$ raise a kennelll of Hounds shall hunt him so$5#1$, 
004:02;E4v[A  ]| As all his footmanship shall scarce preuaile, 
004:02;E4v[A  ]| To$9$ keepe his Carkasse from their bloudy phangs.  
004:02;E4v[A  ]| Ho, Belimote, Argiron, Asterote.  
004:02;E4v[R  ]| Hold, hold:  zounds he will$1$ raise up$5$ a kennell of Diuels 
004:02;E4v[R  ]| I think anon:  good my Lord intreate for$4$ me:  'sbloud I am 
004:02;E4v[R  ]| <reg orig="neuer">never</reg> able to$9$ endure these torments.  
004:02;E4v[WO ]| Then good M% Doctor, 
004:02;E4v[WO ]| Let me intreate you to$9$ remoue his hornes, 
004:02;E4v[WO ]| He has done penance now sufficiently.  
004:02;E4v[A  ]| My gracious Lord, not so$5#1$ much for$4$ iniury done to$4$ 
004:02;E4v[A  ]| me, as to$9$ delight your Maiesty with some mirth:  hath Faustus  
004:02;E4v[A  ]| iustly requited this iniurious knight, which$6#1$ being all I desire, 
004:02;E4v[A  ]| I am content to$9$ remoue his hornes.  Mephastophilis,  
004:02;E4v[A  ]| transforme him; and hereafter sir, look you speak well of 
004:02;E4v[A  ]| Schollers.  
004:02;E4v[R  ]| Speak well of ye?  'sbloud if Schollers be such 
004:02;E4v[R  ]| Cuckold-makers to$9$ clap hornes of honest mens heades of this 
004:02;E4v[R  ]| order, I will$1$ <reg orig="nere">never</reg> trust smooth faces, and small ruffes more.  But 
004:02;F1r[R  ]| if I be not reueng'd for$4$ this, would I might be turn'd to$4$ a 
004:02;F1r[R  ]| gaping Oyster, and drinke nothing but salt water.  
004:02;F1r[WO ]| Come Faustus while the Emperour liues, 
004:02;F1r[WO ]| In$4$ recompence of this thy high desert, 
004:02;F1r[WO ]| Thou shalt command the state of Germany, 
004:02;F1r[WO ]| And live belou'd of mightie Carolus.  
004:02;F1r['  ]| Exeunt omnes. 
004:03;F1r['  ]| Enter Benvolio, Martino, Fredericke, and 
004:03;F1r['  ]| Souldiers. 
004:03;F1r[P  ]| Nay sweet Benvolio, let us$6#2$ sway thy thoughts 
004:03;F1r[P  ]| From this attempt against the Coniurer.  
004:03;F1r[R  ]| Away, you love me not, to$9$ vrge me thus, 
004:03;F1r[R  ]| Shall I let slip so$5#1$ great an iniury, 
004:03;F1r[R  ]| When <reg orig="euery">every</reg> seruile groome ieasts at my wrongs, 
004:03;F1r[R  ]| And in$4$ their rusticke gambals proudly say, 
004:03;F1r[R  ]| Benvolio's head was grac't with hornes today?  
004:03;F1r[R  ]| O may these eye-lids <reg orig="neuer">never</reg> close again, 
004:03;F1r[R  ]| Till with my sword I have that$6#2$ Coniurer slaine.  
004:03;F1r[R  ]| If you will$1$ aide me in$4$ this enterprise, 
004:03;F1r[R  ]| Then draw your weapons, and be resolute:  
004:03;F1r[R  ]| If not, depart:  here will$1$ Benvolio die, 
004:03;F1r[R  ]| But Faustus death shall quit my infamie.  
004:03;F1r[Q  ]| Nay, we$6#2$ will$1$ stay with thee, betide what may, 
004:03;F1r[Q  ]| And kill that$6#2$ Doctor if he come this way.  
004:03;F1r[R  ]| Then gentle Fredericke hie thee to$4$ the groue, 
004:03;F1r[R  ]| And place our$6#1$ seruants, and our$6#1$ followers 
004:03;F1r[R  ]| close in$4$ an ambush there behinde the trees, 
004:03;F1r[R  ]| By$4$ this (I know) the Coniurer is neere, 
004:03;F1r[R  ]| I saw him kneele, and kisse the Emperours hand, 
004:03;F1r[R  ]| And take his leaue, laden with rich rewards.  
004:03;F1r[R  ]| Then Souldiers boldly fight; if Faustus die, 
004:03;F1r[R  ]| Take you the wealth, leaue us$6#2$ the victorie.  
004:03;F1r[Q  ]| Come souldiers, follow me unto the groue, 
004:03;F1r[Q  ]| Who$6#1$ kils him shall have gold, and endlesse love.  
004:03;F1r['  ]| Exit Frederick with the Souldiers. 
004:03;F1r[R  ]| My head is lighter than it was by$4$ the hornes, 
004:03;F1v[R  ]| But yet my heart more ponderous than my head, 
004:03;F1v[R  ]| And pants vntill I see that$6#2$ Coniurer dead.  
004:03;F1v[P  ]| Where shall we$6#2$ place ourselves Benvolio?  
004:03;F1v[R  ]| Here will$1$ we$6#2$ stay to$9$ bide the first assault, 
004:03;F1v[R  ]| O were that$6#2$ damned Hell-hound but in$4$ place, 
004:03;F1v[R  ]| Thou soon shouldst see me quit my foule disgrace.  
004:03;F1v['  ]| Enter Fredericke. 
004:03;F1v[Q  ]| Close, close, the Coniurer is at hand, 
004:03;F1v[Q  ]| And all alone, comes walking in$4$ his gowne; 
004:03;F1v[Q  ]| Be ready then, and strike the Peasant down.  
004:03;F1v[R  ]| Mine be that$6#2$ honour then:  now sword strike home, 
004:03;F1v[R  ]| For$4$ hornes he gaue, I will$1$ have his head anone.  
004:03;F1v['  ]| Enter Faustus with the false head. 
004:03;F1v[P  ]| See, see, he comes.  
004:03;F1v[R  ]| No$2$ words:  this blow ends all,

004:03;F1v[A  ]| O.  
004:03;F1v[Q  ]| Grone you Master Doctor?  
004:03;F1v[R  ]| Breake may his heart with grones:  deere Frederick see 
004:03;F1v[R  ]| Thus will$1$ I end his griefes immediately.  
004:03;F1v[P  ]| Strike with a willing hand, his head is off.  
004:03;F1v[R  ]| The Diuel is dead, the Furies now may laugh.  
004:03;F1v[Q  ]| Was this that$6#2$ sterne aspect, that$6#2$ awfull frowne, 
004:03;F1v[Q  ]| Made the grim monarch of infernall spirits, 
004:03;F1v[Q  ]| Tremble and quake at his commanding charmes?  
004:03;F1v[P  ]| Was this that$6#2$ damned head, whose heart conspir'd 
004:03;F1v[P  ]| Benvolio's shame before the Emperour.  
004:03;F1v[R  ]| Aye, that$6#2$ is the head, and here the body lies, 
004:03;F1v[R  ]| Iustly rewarded for$4$ his villanies.  
004:03;F1v[Q  ]| Come, let us$6#2$ deuise how we$6#2$ may adde more shame 
004:03;F1v[Q  ]| To$4$ the blacke scandall of his hated name.  
004:03;F1v[R  ]| First, on$4$ his head, in$4$ quittance of my wrongs, 
004:03;F1v[R  ]| I will$1$ naile huge forked hornes, and let them hang 
004:03;F1v[R  ]| Within$4$ the window where he yoak'd me first, 
004:03;F1v[R  ]| That$3$ all the world may see my iust reuenge.  
004:03;F1v[P  ]| What vse shall we$6#2$ put his beard to$5$?  
004:03;F2r[R  ]| We$6#2$ will$1$ sell it to$4$ a Chimny-sweeper:  it will$1$ weare out 
004:03;F2r[R  ]| ten birchin broomes I warrant you.  
004:03;F2r[Q  ]| What shall eyes do?  
004:03;F2r[R  ]| We$6#2$ will$1$ put out his eyes, and they shall serue for$4$ buttons 
004:03;F2r[R  ]| to$4$ his lips, to$9$ keepe his tongue from catching cold.  
004:03;F2r[P  ]| An excellent policie:  and now sirs, having diuided

004:03;F2r[Q  ]| Give him his head for$4$ Gods sake.  
004:03;F2r[A  ]| Nay keepe it:  Faustus will$1$ have heads and hands, 
004:03;F2r[A  ]| I call your hearts to$9$ recompence this deed.  
004:03;F2r[A  ]| Knew you not Traytors, I was limitted 
004:03;F2r[A  ]| For$4$ foure*and*twenty yeares, to$9$ breathe on$4$ earth?  
004:03;F2r[A  ]| And had you cut my body with your swords, 
004:03;F2r[A  ]| Or hew'd this flesh and bones as small as sand, 
004:03;F2r[A  ]| Yet in$4$ a minute had my spirit return'd, 
004:03;F2r[A  ]| And I had breath'd a man made free from harme.  
004:03;F2r[A  ]| But wherefore do I dally my reuenge?

004:03;F2r[A  ]| Go horse these traytors on$4$ your fiery backes,

004:03;F2r[A  ]| Go Belimothe, and take this caitife hence,

004:05;F3r[A  ]| hast a good minde to$4$ him.  
004:05;F3r[T  ]| I beseech you sir accept of this; I am a very poore

004:05;F3v[A  ]| What art thou Faustus but a man condemn'd to$9$ die?  
004:05;F3v[A  ]| Thy fatall time drawes to$4$ a finall end; 
004:05;F3v[A  ]| Despaire doth driue distrust into my thoughts.  
004:05;F3v[A  ]| Confound these passions with a quiet sleepe:  
004:05;F3v[A  ]| Tush Christ did call the Theefe upon$4$ the Crosse, 
004:05;F3v[A  ]| Then rest thee Faustus quiet in$4$ conceit.

004:05;F3v['  ]| Enter the Horse-courser wet. 
004:05;F3v[T  ]| O what a cosening Doctor was this?  I riding my 
004:05;F3v[T  ]| horse into the water, thinking some hidden mystery had been 
004:05;F3v[T  ]| in$4$ the horse, I had nothing under me but a little straw, and 
004:05;F3v[T  ]| had much ado to$9$ escape drowning:  Well I will$1$ go rouse him,  
004:05;F3v[T  ]| and make him give me my forty Dollors again.  Ho sirra

004:05;F3v[A  ]| O help, help, the villaine hath murder'd me.  
004:05;F3v[T  ]| Murder or not murder, now he has but one leg, 
004:05;F3v[T  ]| I will$1$ out-run him, and cast this leg into some ditch or other. 
004:05;F3v[A  ]| Stop him, stop him, stop him ~~ ha, ha, ha, Faustus

004:06;F4r[VA ]| How now, what lacke you?  What my old Guesse 
004:06;F4r[VA ]| welcome.  
004:06;F4r[G  ]| Sirra Dick, dost thou know why I stand so$5#1$ mute?  
004:06;F4r[M  ]| No$7$ Robin, why is it?  
004:06;F4r[G  ]| I am eighteene pence on$4$ the score, but say nothing, 
004:06;F4r[G  ]| see if she have forgotten me.  
004:06;F4r[VA ]| Who$6#2$ is this, that$6#2$ stands so$5#1$ solemnly by$4$ himself:  
004:06;F4r[VA ]| what my old Guest?  
004:06;F4r[G  ]| O Hostisse how do you?  I hope my score stands still.  
004:06;F4r[VA ]| Aye there is no$2$ doubt of that$6#2$, for$4$ methinks you make  
004:06;F4r[VA ]| no$2$ hast to$9$ wipe it out.  
004:06;F4r[M  ]| Why Hostesse, I say, fetch us$6#2$ some Beere.  
004:06;F4r[VA ]| You shall presently:  look up$5$ into the hall there ho.  
004:06;F4r['  ]| Exit. 
004:06;F4r[M  ]| Come sirs, what shall we$6#2$ do now till mine Hostesse 
004:06;F4r[M  ]| comes?  
004:06;F4r[WO ]| Marry sir, I will$1$ tell you the brauest tale how a Coniurer 
004:06;F4r[WO ]| seru'd me; you know Doctor Fauster.  
004:06;F4r[T  ]| Aye, a plague take him, here is some of us$6#2$ have cause 
004:06;F4r[T  ]| to$9$ know him; did he coniure thee too?  
004:06;F4r[WP ]| I will$1$ tell you how he seru'd me:  As I was going to$4$ 
004:06;F4r[WP ]| Wittenberge the other day, with a loade of Hay, he met me, 
004:06;F4r[WP ]| and asked me what he should give me for$4$ as much Hay as he 
004:06;F4r[WP ]| could eate; now sir, I thinking that$3$ a little would serue his 
004:06;F4r[WP ]| turne, bad him take as much as he would for$4$ three-farthings; 
004:06;F4r[WP ]| so$3$ he presently gaue me my money, and fell to$4$ eating; and as I 
004:06;F4r[WP ]| am a cursen man, he <reg orig="neuer">never</reg> left eating, till he had eate up$5$ all 
004:06;F4r[WP ]| my loade of hay.  
004:06;F4r[X  ]| O monstrous, eate a whole load of Hay!  
004:06;F4v[G  ]| Yes, yes, that$6#2$ may be; for$4$ I have heard of one, that$6#1$ 
004:06;F4v[G  ]| has eate a load of logges.  
004:06;F4v[T  ]| Now sirs, you shall hear how villanously he seru'd 
004:06;F4v[T  ]| me:  I went to$4$ him yesterday to$9$ buy a horse of him, and he 
004:06;F4v[T  ]| would by$4$ no$2$ meanes sell him under 40 Dollors; so$3$ sir, because 
004:06;F4v[T  ]| I knew him to$9$ be such a horse, as would run over hedge and 
004:06;F4v[T  ]| ditch, and <reg orig="neuer">never</reg> tyre, I gaue him his money; so$3$ when I had 
004:06;F4v[T  ]| my horse, Doctor Fauster bad me ride him night and day, and 
004:06;F4v[T  ]| spare him no$2$ time; but, quoth he, in$4$ any case ride him not into 
004:06;F4v[T  ]| the water.  Now sir, I thinking the horse had had some  
004:06;F4v[T  ]| quality that$6#1$ he would not have me know of, what did I but 
004:06;F4v[T  ]| ride him into a great riuer, and when I came iust in$4$ the midst 
004:06;F4v[T  ]| my horse vanisht away, and I sate stradding upon$4$ a bottle 
004:06;F4v[T  ]| of Hay.  
004:06;F4v[X  ]| O braue Doctor.  
004:06;F4v[T  ]| But you shall hear how brauely I seru'd him for$4$ 
004:06;F4v[T  ]| it; I went me home to$4$ his house, and there I found him 
004:06;F4v[T  ]| asleepe; I kept a*hallowing and whooping in$4$ his eares, but 
004:06;F4v[T  ]| all could not wake him: I seeing that$6#2$, tooke him by$4$ the leg, 
004:06;F4v[T  ]| and <reg orig="neuer">never</reg> rested pulling, till I had pul'd me his leg quite off, 
004:06;F4v[T  ]| and now it is at home in$4$ mine Hostry.  
004:06;F4v[G  ]| And has the Doctor but one leg then?  that$6#2$ is excellent, 
004:06;F4v[G  ]| for$3$ one of his deuils turn'd me, into the likenesse of an 
004:06;F4v[G  ]| Apes face.  
004:06;F4v[WP ]| Some more drinke Hostesse.  
004:06;F4v[G  ]| Hearke you, we$6#2$ will$1$ into another roome and drinke 
004:06;F4v[G  ]| a while, and then we$6#2$ will$1$ go seeke out the Doctor.  
004:06;F4v['  ]| Exeunt omnes.  
004:07;F4v['  ]| Enter the Duke of Vanholt; his Dutches, 
004:07;F4v['  ]| Faustus, and Mephostophilis. 
004:07;F4v[Y  ]| Thankes Maister Doctor, for$4$ these pleasant sights, 
004:07;F4v[Y  ]| Nor know I how sufficiently to$9$ recompence your great deserts 
004:07;F4v[Y  ]| in$4$ erecting that$6#2$ inchanted Castle in$4$ the Aire:  the 
004:07;F4v[Y  ]| Sight whereof so$5#1$ delighted me, 
004:07;F4v[Y  ]| As nothing in$4$ the world could please me more.  
004:07;G1r[A  ]| I do think myself my good Lord, highly recompenced,

004:07;G1r[A  ]| that$6#2$ which$6#1$ Faustus hath performed.  But gratious Lady, it 
004:07;G1r[A  ]| may be, that$3$ you have taken no$2$ pleasure in$4$ those sights; 
004:07;G1r[A  ]| <reg orig="therefor">therefore</reg> I pray you tell me, what is the thing you most desire

004:07;G1r[A  ]| dainty.  
004:07;G1r[S  ]| True Maister Doctor, 
004:07;G1r[S  ]| and since I finde you so$5#1$ kind I will$1$ 
004:07;G1r[S  ]| make knowne unto you what my heart desires to$9$ 
004:07;G1r[S  ]| have, and were it now Summer, as it is Ianuary, a dead 
004:07;G1r[S  ]| time of the Winter, I would request no$2$ better meate, than 
004:07;G1r[S  ]| a dish of ripe grapes.  
004:07;G1r[A  ]| This is but a small matter:  Go Mephostophilis, away.  
004:07;G1r['  ]| Exit Mephosto. 
004:07;G1r[A  ]| Madam, I will$1$ do more than this for$4$ your content.  
004:07;G1r['  ]| Enter Mepho% agen with the grapes. 
004:07;G1r[A  ]| Here, now taste ye these, they should be good 
004:07;G1r[A  ]| For$3$ they come from a farre Contry I can tell you.  
004:07;G1r[Y  ]| This makes me wonder more than all the rest, that$3$
004:07;G1r[Y  ]| at this time of the yeare, when <reg orig="euery">every</reg> Tree is barren of his 
004:07;G1r[Y  ]| fruite, from whence you had these ripe grapes.  
004:07;G1r[A  ]| Please it your grace, the yeare is diuided into two 
004:07;G1r[A  ]| circles over the whole world, so$3$ that$3$ when it is Winter with 
004:07;G1r[A  ]| us$6#2$, in$4$ the contrary circle it is likewise Summer with them,  
004:07;G1r[A  ]| as in$4$ India, Saba, and such Countries that$6#1$ lye farre East, 
004:07;G1r[A  ]| where they have fruit twice a yeare.  From whence, by$4$ meanes  
004:07;G1r[A  ]| of a swift spirit that$6#1$ I have, I had these grapes brought as 
004:07;G1r[A  ]| you see.  
004:07;G1r[S  ]| And trust me, they are the sweetest grapes that$3$ 
004:07;G1r[S  ]| <reg orig="e're">ever</reg> I tasted.  
004:07;G1r['  ]| The Clowne bounce at the gate, within. 
004:07;G1v[Y  ]| What rude disturbers have we$6#1$ at the gate?  
004:07;G1v[Y  ]| Go pacifie their fury set it ope, 
004:07;G1v[Y  ]| And then demand of them, what they would have.  
004:07;G1v['  ]| They knocke again, and call out to$9$ talke with Faustus. 
004:07;G1v[WR ]| Why how now Maisters, what a coyle is 
004:07;G1v[WR ]| there?  What is the reason you disturbe the Duke?  
004:07;G1v[M  ]| We$6#2$ have no$2$ reason for$4$ it, therefore a fig for$4$ him.  
004:07;G1v[WR ]| Why saucy varlets, dare you be so$5#1$ bold.  
004:07;G1v[T  ]| I hope sir, we$6#2$ have wit enough to$9$ be more bold 
004:07;G1v[T  ]| than welcome.  
004:07;G1v[WR ]| It appeares so$5#2$, pray be bold else-where, 
004:07;G1v[WR ]| And trouble not the Duke.  
004:07;G1v[Y  ]| What would they have?  
004:07;G1v[WR ]| They all cry out to$9$ speak with Doctor Faustus.  
004:07;G1v[WR ]| Aye, and we$6#2$ will$1$ speak with him.  
004:07;G1v[Y  ]| Will$1$ you sir?  Commit the Rascals.  
004:07;G1v[M  ]| Commit with us$6#2$, he were as good commit with his 
004:07;G1v[M  ]| father, as commit with us$6#2$.  
004:07;G1v[A  ]| I do beseech your grace let them come in$5$, 
004:07;G1v[A  ]| They are good subiect for$4$ a merriment.  
004:07;G1v[Y  ]| Do as thou wilt Faustus, I give thee leaue.

004:07;G2r[A  ]| Be not so$5#1$ furious:  come you shall have Beere.  
004:07;G2r[A  ]| My Lord, beseech you give me leaue a while, 
004:07;G2r[A  ]| I will$1$ gage my credit, it will$1$ content your grace.

004:07;G2r[WP ]| Good Lord, that$3$ flesh and bloud should be so$5#1$ fraile 
004:07;G2r[WP ]| with your Worship:  Do not you remember a Horse-courser 
004:07;G2r[WP ]| you sold a horse to$5$?  
004:07;G2r[A  ]| Yes, I remember I sold one a horse.

005:01;G3r[B  ]| wonder what he meanes, if death were nie, he would not frolick 
005:01;G3r[B  ]| thus:  he is now at supper with the schollers, where there is

005:01;G3r['  ]| Schollers. 
005:01;G3r[I  ]| M% Doctor Faustus, since our$6#2$ conference about

005:01;G3r[I  ]| have determin'd with ourselves, that$3$ Helen of Greece was 
005:01;G3r[I  ]| the admirablest Lady that$6#1$ <reg orig="euer">ever</reg> liu'd:  therefore M% Doctor, if 
005:01;G3r[I  ]| you will$1$ do us$6#2$ so$5#1$ much fauour, 
100:04;A2V[U  ]| as to$9$ let us$6#2$ see the peerelesse

005:01;G3r[I  ]| should think ourselves much beholding unto you.  
005:01;G3r[A  ]| Gentlemen, for$3$ that$3$ I know your friendship is vnfain'd, 
005:01;G3r[A  ]| It is not Faustus custome to$9$ deny 
005:01;G3r[A  ]| The iust request of those that$6#1$ wish him well:  
005:01;G3r[A  ]| You shall behold that$6#2$ peerelesse dame of Greece, 
005:01;G3r[A  ]| No$2$ otherwise for$4$ pompe or Maiesty, 
005:01;G3r[A  ]| Than when sir Paris crost the seas with her$6$, 
005:01;G3r[A  ]| And brought the spoyles to$4$ rich Dardania:  
005:01;G3r[A  ]| Be silent then, for$3$ danger is in$4$ words.

005:01;G3r['  ]| over the stage. 
005:01;G3r[J  ]| Was this fair Hellen, whose admired worth 
005:01;G3r[J  ]| Made Greece with ten yeares warres afflict poore Troy?  
005:01;G3r[WS ]| Too simple is my wit to$9$ tell her$2$ worth, 
005:01;G3r[WS ]| Whom all the world admires for$4$ maiesty.  
005:01;G3r[I  ]| Now we$6#2$ have seene the pride of Natures worke,

005:01;G3v['  ]| Enter an old Man. 
005:01;G3v[Z  ]| O gentle Faustus leaue this damned Art&H0;, 
005:01;G3v[Z  ]| This Magicke, that$6#1$ will$1$ charme thy soule to$4$ hell, 
005:01;G3v[Z  ]| And quite bereaue thee of saluation.  
005:01;G3v[Z  ]| Though thou hast now offended like$4$ a man, 
005:01;G3v[Z  ]| Do not perseuer in$4$ it like$4$ a Diuell; 
005:01;G3v[Z  ]| Yet, yet, thou hast an amiable soule, 
005:01;G3v[Z  ]| If sin by$4$ custome grow not into nature:  
005:01;G3v[Z  ]| Then Faustus, will$1$ repentance come too late, 
005:01;G3v[Z  ]| Then thou art banisht from the sight of heauen; 
005:01;G3v[Z  ]| No$2$ mortall can expresse the paines of hell.  
005:01;G3v[Z  ]| It may be this my exhortation 
005:01;G3v[Z  ]| Seemes harsh, and all vnpleasant; let it not, 
005:01;G3v[Z  ]| For$3$ gentle sonne, I speak it not in$4$ wrath, 
005:01;G3v[Z  ]| Or enuy of thee, but in$4$ tender love, 
005:01;G3v[Z  ]| And pitty of thy future miserie.  
005:01;G3v[Z  ]| And so$5#2$ have hope, that$3$ this my kinde rebuke, 
005:01;G3v[Z  ]| Checking thy body, may amend thy soule.  
005:01;G3v[A  ]| Where art thou Faustus?  wretch, what hast thou done?  
005:01;G3v[A  ]| Hell claimes his right, and with a roaring voice, 
005:01;G3v['  ]| Meph% giues him a dagger. 
005:01;G3v[A  ]| Saies Faustus come, thine houre is almost come, 
005:01;G3v[A  ]| And Faustus now will$1$ come to$9$ do thee right.  
005:01;G3v[Z  ]| O stay good Faustus, stay thy desperate steps.  
005:01;G3v[Z  ]| I see an Angell houer <reg orig="ore">over</reg> thy head, 
005:01;G3v[Z  ]| And with a vyoll full of pretious grace, 
005:01;G3v[Z  ]| Offers to$9$ poure the same into thy soule, 
005:01;G3v[Z  ]| Then call for$4$ mercy, and auoyd despaire.  
005:01;G3v[A  ]| O friend, I feele thy words to$9$ comfort my distressed soule, 
005:01;G3v[A  ]| Leaue me a while, to$9$ ponder on$4$ my sinnes.  
005:01;G3v[Z  ]| Faustus I leaue thee, but with griefe of heart, 
005:01;G3v[Z  ]| Fearing the enemy of thy haplesse soule.  
005:01;G3v['  ]| Exit. 
005:01;G3v[A  ]| Accursed Faustus, wretch what hast thou done?  
005:01;G3v[A  ]| I do repent, and yet I do despaire, 
005:01;G3v[A  ]| Hell striues with grace for$4$ conquest in$4$ my breast:  
005:01;G3v[A  ]| What shall I do to$9$ shun the snares of death?  
005:01;G3v[F  ]| Thou traytor Faustus, I arrest thy soule, 
005:01;G3v[F  ]| For$4$ disobedience to$4$ my soueraigne lord, 
005:01;G4r[F  ]| Reuolt, or I will$1$ in$4$ peece-meale teare thy flesh.  
005:01;G4r[A  ]| I do repent I ere offended him, 
005:01;G4r[A  ]| Sweet Mephasto: intreat thy Lord 
005:01;G4r[A  ]| To$9$ pardon my vniust presumption, 
005:01;G4r[A  ]| And with my bloud again I will$1$ confirme 
005:01;G4r[A  ]| The former vow I made to$4$ Lucifer.  
005:01;G4r[A  ]| Do it then Faustus, with vnfained heart, 
005:01;G4r[A  ]| Lest greater dangers do attend thy drift.  
005:01;G4r[A  ]| Torment sweet friend, that$6#2$ base and aged man, 
005:01;G4r[A  ]| That$6#1$ durst disswade me from thy Lucifer.  
005:01;G4r[A  ]| With greatest torment that$6#1$ our$6#2$ hell affoords.  
005:01;G4r[F  ]| His faith is great, I cannot touch his soule; 
005:01;G4r[F  ]| But what I may afflict his body with, 
005:01;G4r[F  ]| I will$1$ attempt, which$6#1$ is but little worth.  
005:01;G4r[A  ]| One thing good seruant let me craue of thee, 
005:01;G4r[A  ]| To$9$ glut the longing of my hearts desire, 
005:01;G4r[A  ]| That$3$ I may have unto my paramour, 
005:01;G4r[A  ]| That$6#2$ heauenly Hellen, which$6#1$ I saw of late, 
005:01;G4r[A  ]| Whose sweet embraces may extinguish cleare, 
005:01;G4r[A  ]| Those thoughts that$6#1$ do disswade me from my vow, 
005:01;G4r[A  ]| And keepe my vow I made to$4$ Lucifer.  
005:01;G4r[F  ]| This, or what else my Faustus shall desire, 
005:01;G4r[F  ]| Shall be perform'd in$4$ twinkling of an eye.  
005:01;G4r['  ]| Enter Hellen again, passing over <reg orig="betweene">between</reg> 
005:01;G4r['  ]| two Cupids. 
005:01;G4r[A  ]| Was this the face that$6#1$ Launcht a thousand ships, 
005:01;G4r[A  ]| And burnt the toplesse Towers of Ilium?  
005:01;G4r[A  ]| Sweet Hellen make me immortall with a kisse:  
005:01;G4r[A  ]| Her$2$ lips sucke forth my soule, see where it flies.  
005:01;G4r[A  ]| Come Hellen, come, give me my soule again, 
005:01;G4r[A  ]| Here will$1$ I dwell, for$3$ heauen is in$4$ these lippes, 
005:01;G4r[A  ]| And all is drosse that$6#1$ is not Helena.  
005:01;G4r[A  ]| I will$1$ be Paris, and for$4$ love of thee, 
005:01;G4r[A  ]| In*stead of Troy shall Wittenberg be sack't, 
005:01;G4r[A  ]| And I will$1$ combat with weake Menelaus, 
005:01;G4r[A  ]| And weare thy colours on$4$ my plumed crest.  
005:01;G4v[A  ]| Yea, I will$1$ wound Achilles in$4$ the heele, 
005:01;G4v[A  ]| And then returne to$4$ Hellen for$4$ a kisse.  
005:01;G4v[A  ]| O thou art fairer than the euenings aire, 
005:01;G4v[A  ]| Clad in$4$ the beauty of a thousand starres:  
005:01;G4v[A  ]| Brighter art thou than flaming Iupiter, 
005:01;G4v[A  ]| When he appear'd to$4$ haplesse Semele:

005:01;G4v[A  ]| In$4$ wanton Arethusa's azure armes, 
005:01;G4v[A  ]| And none but thou shalt be my Paramour.  
005:01;G4v['  ]| Exeunt. 
005:02;G4v['  ]| Thunder.  Enter Lucifer, Belzebub, and Mephostophilis. 
005:02;G4v[K  ]| Thus from infernall Dis do we$6#1$ ascend 
005:02;G4v[K  ]| To$9$ view the subiects of our$6#1$ Monarchy, 
005:02;G4v[K  ]| Those soules which$6#1$ sinne, seales the blacke sonnes of hell,

005:02;G4v[F  ]| And this gloomy night, 
005:02;G4v[F  ]| Here in$4$ this roome will$1$ wretched Faustus be.  
005:02;G4v[L  ]| And here we$6#2$ will$1$ stay, 
005:02;G4v[L  ]| To$9$ marke him how he doth demeane himself.  
005:02;G4v[F  ]| How should he, but in$4$ desperate lunacie.  
005:02;G4v[F  ]| Fond worldling, now his heart bloud dries with griefe; 
005:02;G4v[F  ]| His conscience kils it, and his labouring braine, 
005:02;G4v[F  ]| Begets a world of idle fantasies, 
005:02;G4v[F  ]| To$9$ ouer-reach the Diuell; but all in$4$ vaine, 
005:02;G4v[F  ]| His store of pleasures must be sauc'd with paine.  
005:02;G4v[F  ]| He and his seruant Wagner are at hand,

005:02;G4v[F  ]| See where they come.  
005:02;G4v['  ]| Enter Faustus and Wagner. 
005:02;G4v[A  ]| Say Wagner, thou hast perus'd my will$0$, 
005:02;G4v[A  ]| How dost thou like$1$ it?  
005:02;G4v[B  ]| Sir, so$5#1$ wondrous well,

005:02;H1r[A  ]| Gramercies Wagner.  Welcome gentlemen.  
005:02;H1r[I  ]| Now worthy Faustus:  methinks your looks are chang'd.  
005:02;H1r[A  ]| O gentlemen.  
005:02;H1r[J  ]| What ailes Faustus?  
005:02;H1r[A  ]| Ah my sweet chamber-fellow, had I liu'd with thee, 
005:02;H1r[A  ]| Then had I liued still, but now must dye eternally.  
005:02;H1r[A  ]| Look sirs, comes he not, comes he not?  
005:02;H1r[I  ]| O my deere Faustus what imports this feare?  
005:02;H1r[J  ]| Is all our$6#2$ pleasure turn'd to$4$ melancholy?  
005:02;H1r[WQ ]| He is not well with being ouer*solitarie.  
005:02;H1r[J  ]| If it be so$5#2$, we$6#2$ will$1$ have Physitians, and Faustus shall be 
005:02;H1r[J  ]| cur'd.  
005:02;H1r[WQ ]| It is but a surfet sir, feare nothing.  
005:02;H1r[A  ]| A surfet of deadly sin, that$6#1$ hath damn'd both body 
005:02;H1r[A  ]| and soule.  
005:02;H1r[J  ]| Yet Faustus look up$5$ to$4$ heauen, and remember mercy is 
005:02;H1r[J  ]| infinite.  
005:02;H1r[A  ]| But Faustus offence can <reg orig="nere">never</reg> be pardoned, 
005:02;H1r[A  ]| The serpent that$6#1$ tempted Eue may be saued, 
005:02;H1r[A  ]| But not Faustus.  O gentlemen, hear with patience and tremble 
005:02;H1r[A  ]| not at my speeches, though my heart pant and quiuer to$9$ remember 
005:02;H1r[A  ]| that$3$ I have been a student here these 30 yeares.  O

005:02;H1r[A  ]| world, for$4$ which$6#1$ Faustus hath lost both Germany and the world,  
005:02;H1r[A  ]| yea heauen itself:  heauen the seate of God, the Throne of 
005:02;H1r[A  ]| the Blessed, the Kingdome of Ioy, and must remaine in$4$ hell 
005:02;H1r[A  ]| <reg orig="for euer">forever</reg>.  Hell, O hell <reg orig="for euer">forever</reg>.  Sweet friends, what shall become  
005:02;H1r[A  ]| of Faustus being in$4$ hell <reg orig="for euer">forever</reg>?  
005:02;H1r[J  ]| Yet Faustus call on$4$ God.  
005:02;H1r[A  ]| On$4$ God, whom Faustus hath abiur'd?  on$4$ God, whom 
005:02;H1r[A  ]| Faustus hath blasphem'd?  O my God, I would weepe, but the 
005:02;H1r[A  ]| Diuell drawes in$4$ my teares.  Gush forth bloud in*stead of 
005:02;H1r[A  ]| teares, yea life and soule:  o he stayes my tongue:  I would 
005:02;H1r[A  ]| lift up$5$ my hands, but see they hold them, they hold them.  
005:02;H1r[X  ]| Who$6#2$ Faustus?  
005:02;H1r[A  ]| Why Lucifer and Mephostophilis:  O gentlemen, 
005:02;H1v[A  ]| I gaue them my soule for$4$ my cunning.  
005:02;H1v[X  ]| O God forbid.  
005:02;H1v[A  ]| God forbade it indeed, but Faustus hath done it:  for$4$ 
005:02;H1v[A  ]| the vaine pleasure of foure*and*twenty yeares hath Faustus 
005:02;H1v[A  ]| lost eternall ioy and felicitie.  I writ them a bill with mine 
005:02;H1v[A  ]| <reg orig="owne">own</reg> bloud, the date is expired:  this is the time, and he will$1$ 
005:02;H1v[A  ]| fetch me.  
005:02;H1v[I  ]| Why did not Faustus tell us$6#2$ of this before, that$3$ Diuines 
005:02;H1v[I  ]| might have prayd for$4$ thee?  
005:02;H1v[A  ]| Oft have I thought to$9$ have done so$5#2$:  but the Diuel 
005:02;H1v[A  ]| threatned to$9$ teare me in$4$ peeces if I nam'd God:  to$9$ fetch me 
005:02;H1v[A  ]| body and soule, if I once gaue eare to$4$ Diuinitie:  and now 
005:02;H1v[A  ]| it is too late.  Gentlemen away, least you perish with 
005:02;H1v[A  ]| me.  
005:02;H1v[J  ]| O what may we$6#2$ do to$9$ saue Faustus?  
005:02;H1v[A  ]| Talke not of me, but saue yourselves and depart.  
005:02;H1v[WQ ]| God will$1$ strengthen me, I will$1$ stay with Faustus.  
005:02;H1v[I  ]| Tempt not God sweet friend, but let us$6#2$ into the next 
005:02;H1v[I  ]| roome, and pray for$4$ him.  
005:02;H1v[A  ]| Aye, pray for$4$ me, pray for$4$ me:  and what noyse soeuer  
005:02;H1v[A  ]| you hear, come not unto me, for$3$ nothing can rescue me.  
005:02;H1v[J  ]| Pray thou, and we$6#2$ will$1$ pray, that$3$ God may have mercie 
005:02;H1v[J  ]| upon$4$ thee.  
005:02;H1v[A  ]| Gentlemen farewell:  if I live till morning, I will$1$ visit 
005:02;H1v[A  ]| you:  if not, Faustus is gone to$4$ hell.  
005:02;H1v[X  ]| Faustus, farewell.  
005:02;H1v['  ]| Exeunt Schollers. 
005:02;H1v[F  ]| Aye Faustus, now thou hast no$2$ hope of heauen, 
005:02;H1v[F  ]| Therefore despaire, think onely upon$4$ hell; 
005:02;H1v[F  ]| For$3$ that$6#2$ must be thy mansion, there to$9$ dwell.  
005:02;H1v[A  ]| O thou bewitching fiend, it was thy temptation, 
005:02;H1v[A  ]| Hath rob'd me of eternall happinesse.  
005:02;H1v[F  ]| I do confesse it Faustus, and reioyce; 
005:02;H1v[F  ]| It was I, that$6#1$ when thou wert in$4$ the way to$4$ heauen, 
005:02;H1v[F  ]| Damb'd up$5$ thy passage, when thou took'st the booke, 
005:02;H1v[F  ]| To$9$ view the Scriptures, then I turn'd the leaues 
005:02;H1v[F  ]| And led thine eye.  
005:02;H1v[F  ]| What weep'st thou?  it is too late, despaire, farewell, 
005:02;H2r[F  ]| Fooles that$6#1$ will$1$ laugh on$4$ earth, must weepe in$4$ hell.  
005:02;H2r['  ]| Exit. 
005:02;H2r['  ]| Enter the good Angell, and the bad Angell at 
005:02;H2r['  ]| seuerall doores. 
005:02;H2r[C  ]| O Faustus, if thou hadst giuen eare to$4$ me, 
005:02;H2r[C  ]| Innumerable ioyes had followed thee.  
005:02;H2r[C  ]| But thou didst love the world.  
005:02;H2r[D  ]| Gaue eare to$4$ me, 
005:02;H2r[D  ]| And now must taste hels paines perpetually.  
005:02;H2r[C  ]| O what will$1$ all thy riches, pleasures, pompes, 
005:02;H2r[C  ]| Auaile thee now?  
005:02;H2r[D  ]| Nothing but vexe thee more, 
005:02;H2r[D  ]| To$9$ want in$4$ hell, that$6#1$ had on$4$ earth such store.  
005:02;H2r['  ]| Musicke while the Throne descends. 
005:02;H2r[C  ]| O thou hast lost celestial happinesse, 
005:02;H2r[C  ]| Pleasures vnspeakeable, blisse without end.  
005:02;H2r[C  ]| Hadst thou affected sweet diuinitie, 
005:02;H2r[C  ]| Hell, or the Diuell, had had no$2$ power on$4$ thee.  
005:02;H2r[C  ]| Hadst thou kept on$5$ that$6#2$ way, Faustus behold, 
005:02;H2r[C  ]| In$4$ what resplendant glory thou hadst set 
005:02;H2r[C  ]| In$4$ yonder throne, like$4$ those bright shining Saints, 
005:02;H2r[C  ]| And triumpht over hell, that$6#2$ hast thou lost, 
005:02;H2r[C  ]| And now poore soule must thy good Angell leaue thee, 
005:02;H2r[C  ]| The iawes of hell are open to$9$ receiue thee.  
005:02;H2r['  ]| Exit. 
005:02;H2r['  ]| Hell is discouered. 
005:02;H2r[D  ]| Now Faustus let thine eyes with horror stare 
005:02;H2r[D  ]| Into that$6#2$ vaste perpetuall torture-house, 
005:02;H2r[D  ]| There are the Furies tossing damned soules, 
005:02;H2r[D  ]| On$4$ burning forkes: their bodies broyle in$4$ lead.  
005:02;H2r[D  ]| There are live quarters broyling on$4$ the coles, 
005:02;H2r[D  ]| That$6#1$ <reg orig="ner'e">never</reg> can die:  this euer-burning chaire, 
005:02;H2r[D  ]| Is for$4$ ore-tortur'd soules to$9$ rest them in$5$.  
005:02;H2r[D  ]| These, that$6#1$ are fed with soppes of flaming fire, 
005:02;H2r[D  ]| Were gluttons, and lou'd only delicates, 
005:02;H2r[D  ]| And laught to$9$ see the poore starue at their gates:  
005:02;H2r[D  ]| But yet all these are nothing, thou shalt see 
005:02;H2v[D  ]| ten thousand tortures that$6#1$ more horrid be.  
005:02;H2v[A  ]| O, I have seene enough to$9$ torture me.  
005:02;H2v[D  ]| Nay, thou must feele them, taste the smart of all.  
005:02;H2v[D  ]| He that$6#1$ loues pleasure, must for$4$ pleasure fall:  
005:02;H2v[D  ]| And so$5#2$ I leaue thee Faustus till anon, 
005:02;H2v[D  ]| Then wilt thou tumble in$4$ confusion.  
005:02;H2v['  ]| Exit. 
005:02;H2v['  ]| The Clock strikes eleuen. 
005:02;H2v[A  ]| O Faustus, 
005:02;H2v[A  ]| Now hast thou but one bare houre to$9$ live, 
005:02;H2v[A  ]| And then thou must be damn'd perpetually.  
005:02;H2v[A  ]| Stand still you euer*mouing Spheares of heauen,

005:02;H2v[A  ]| A month, a weeke, a naturall day, 
005:02;H2v[A  ]| That$3$ Faustus may repent, and saue his soule.

005:02;H2v[A  ]| One drop of bloud will$1$ saue me;  o my Christ,

005:02;H2v[A  ]| Yet will$1$ I call on$4$ him:  O spare me Lucifer.  
005:02;H2v[A  ]| Where is it now?  it is gone.  
005:02;H2v[A  ]| And see a threatning Arme, an angry Brow.  
005:02;H2v[A  ]| Mountaines and Hils, come, come, and fall on$4$ me,

005:02;H2v[A  ]| You Starres that$6#1$ raign'd at my natiuity,

005:02;H2v[A  ]| Now draw up$5$ Faustus like$4$ a foggy mist,

005:02;H3r[A  ]| O halfe the houre is past: it will$1$ all be past anone:  
005:02;H3r[A  ]| O, if my soule must suffer for$4$ my sinne, 
005:02;H3r[A  ]| Let Faustus live in$4$ hell a thousand yeares, 
005:02;H3r[A  ]| A hundred thousand, and at last be sau'd.  
005:02;H3r[A  ]| No$2$ end is limited to$4$ damned soules.  
005:02;H3r[A  ]| Why wert thou not a creature wanting soule?
